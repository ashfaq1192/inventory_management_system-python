**Console Based Inventory Management System**

In this project we have made a simple Console Based Inventory Management System with two roles "admin" and "user"
admin can view, edit, update, restock, delete products from the inventory.
User can only view the products. 
For the purpose of viewing only, we have added just two products. We can add more by logging in Using Admin role.
Here are the logging in Information
**Admin**
Username = admin
password = admin123
**User**
username = user
password = user123
